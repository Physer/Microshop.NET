# Every microservice uses [Microtemplate](https://github.com/Physer/Microtemplate/) for project setup

## Status

Accepted

## Context

For consistency between microservices, we should aim for the same architectural structure.

## Decision

In order to keep the architecture consistent, we will use [Microtemplate](https://github.com/Physer/Microtemplate/) to create a microservice.
It's okay to have different projects in the solution, however the layers should be the same.

## Consequences

* Consistent solutions
* Clear separation of concerns
* Easy set-up of new services
